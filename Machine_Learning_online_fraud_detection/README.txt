This is the project for training three machine learning models for online payment fraud detection using the dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis will also be performed.

  
Machine Learning Model Used:
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
Random Forest


The dataset consist of the variable listed below:
1: steps (represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour)
2: type (type of online transaction) 
3: amount (amount of the transcation)
4: nameOrig (customer starting the transaction)
5: oldBalanceOrg (balance before the transaction)
6: newBalanceOrig (balance after the transaction)
7: NameDest (recipient of the transaction)
8: old balance dest (initial balance of recipient before the transaction)
9: new balance dest (the new balance of recipient after the transaction)
10: is Fraud (fraud transaction)

The 10th one is the variable indicated whether that transaction is fraud transaction (1: fraud   0: not fraud)
