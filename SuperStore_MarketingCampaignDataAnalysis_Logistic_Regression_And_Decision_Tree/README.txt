Background of this project

The superstore is going to organize a new marketing campaign this year and want to invite the customers to join the upcoming campaign.
To reduce the cost of invitation and better utilize the capacity of the campaign venue,
the supermarket requests data analysis to identify which type of customers are the high potential participants 
(more willing to accept the campaign offer from superstore) based on last year's campaign data and sends the invitation to the high potential customers.
Also, the superstore requests advice about the improvements we are able to make based on last year's campaign data.
